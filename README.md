# Health Trend: Life Expectancy and Fertility Rate

**Introduction**

This is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a country health trend dataset. After inspecting the data, ensuring that it was clean and complete I identified some key questions that can be answered. I used python libraries, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to examine the dataset and create visuals. I also used Tableau for additional visualisation and for creating a dashboard. 

**Key Questions**

1.	How does life expectancy vary by region?
   
2.	How does the fertility rate vary by region?
   
3.	Which countries have the highest and lowest fertility rates?
   
4.	Are there any trends or patterns in life expectancy over different population sizes?
   
5.	What is the relationship between life expectancy and fertility rate?

**Insights** 

1.	The analysis indicates significant regional differences in life expectancy. Europe & Central Asia (74.04 years), America (73.44 years), and the Middle East & North Africa (72.84 years) regions perform better in terms of average life expectancy, whereas South Asia (64.29 years) and Sub-Saharan Africa (56.48 years) are behind, highlighting the need for targeted health policies and interventions to address the disparities. 

2.	The bar chart reveals significant regional disparities in fertility rates, with Sub-Saharan Africa showing the highest rates and Europe & Central Asia the lowest. These findings highlight the importance of region-specific policies and interventions to address the unique demographic challenges each region faces.  

3.	From the horizontal bar chart, there is a significant disparity in fertility rates between different countries, reflecting varying socio-economic, cultural, and health conditions. Afghanistan, with the highest fertility rate, contrasts sharply with Hong Kong, China, which has the lowest. 

4.	There is a slight downward trend in average life expectancy as the population size increases. Countries with smaller populations tend to have higher average life expectancy compared to those with medium and large populations. Also, there is a noticeable concentration of higher life expectancies among smaller populations, while larger populations show more spread and a tendency towards lower life expectancies. 

5.	With a calculated correlation coefficient is -0.805, indicating a strong negative correlation between life expectancy and fertility rate. This means that as fertility rates increase, life expectancy tends to decrease, and vice versa. Different regions exhibit distinct patterns, but the overall trend of lower life expectancy with higher fertility rates holds true across most regions. This highlights the importance of considering regional contexts when addressing health and demographic policies. 

**Recomendations** 

A developed comprehensive health program that addresses the social determinants of health, focused on education, nutrition, and economic stability alongside direct health interventions. Also, regional co-operation and knowledge sharing about adopting best practices in healthcare and family planning from regions with higher life expectancies and lower fertility rates should be encouraged. Finally, there should an aligned national health policy with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly those related to health (SDG 3), education (SDG 4), and gender equality (SDG 5). 

**Conclusion** 

The findings from this analysis underscore the interconnectedness of health, socio-economic factors, and demographic trends. Regions with lower life expectancy and higher fertility rates often face compounded challenges that require multifaceted policy responses. This analysis provides a valuable framework for policymakers, health organizations, and researchers to understand global health patterns and devise effective strategies to improve health outcomes and quality of life worldwide.

**Ackowledgement** 

I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to SAHIR MAHARAJ, the author and publisher of the Gap minder dataset on Kaggle. The dataset provided a robust foundation for this comprehensive analysis, allowing for meaningful insights into global health and demographic trends.
